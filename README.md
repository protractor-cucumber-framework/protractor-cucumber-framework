This framework was originally part of [angular/protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) and
is now a separate module to decouple [cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).

The project relies on [Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) to enable integration between Protractor and Cucumber 1.x - 7.x and offer support for both [Cucumber.js-native](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/reporting/) and [Serenity/JS reporters](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/index.html). 

Install
-------

`npm install --save-dev protractor-cucumber-framework`

Implementation
--------------

To implement this framework, utilize the `protractor` custom framework config option:

```js
exports.config = {
  // set to "custom" instead of cucumber.
  framework: 'custom',

  // path relative to the current config file
  frameworkPath: require.resolve('protractor-cucumber-framework'),

  // require feature files
  specs: [
    'path/to/feature/files/**/*.feature' // accepts a glob
  ],

  cucumberOpts: {
    // require step definitions
    require: [
      'path/to/step/definitions/**/*.steps.js' // accepts a glob
    ]
  }
};
```

To configure [Serenity/JS reporting services](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/index.html),
consult the [Serenity/JS Handbook](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/integration/serenityjs-and-protractor.html#integrating-protractor-with-serenity-js-and-cucumber).

#### Passing Options to Cucumber.js

All of the `cucumberOpts` will be passed to `cucumberjs` as arguments.

For example, to call cucumberjs with the `--strict`, `--no-colors`, and to specify custom formatters:

```js
cucumberOpts: {
  strict: true,
  'no-colors': true,
  format: ['progress', 'pretty:output.txt'],
  // ...
}
```

The following parameters have special behavior:

 * `require` - globs will be expanded to multiple `--require` arguments
 * `rerun` - value is passed as an argument; for use with the [rerun feature](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/features/rerun_formatter.feature)

#### Formatters when tests are sharded or with multi capabilities

If you have a formatter that outputs to a path and your tests are sharded or you have multi
capabilities then this library will add the PID to the path to make them unique. The reason for
this is multiple processes can write to the same path which ends up clobbering each other.
You'll end up with 1 file per process that protractor spawns.

```js
exports.config = {
  capabilities: {
    shardTestFiles: true,
    // ...
  },

  cucumberOpts: {
    format: 'json:results.json',
    // ...
  }
};
```

If there were 2 feature files then you can expect the following output files...
```
  results.11111.json
  results.22222.json
```
...where the numbers will be the actual PIDs.


#### Uncaught Exceptions

If your process abruptly stops with an exit code `199` then your steps most likely threw an uncaught
exception. Protractor is capturing these and exiting the process in this situation. The solution is
to upgrade to at least protractor version 4.0.10 and add the following to your protractor conf...

```
  ignoreUncaughtExceptions: true
```

This allows cucumber to handle the exception and record it appropriately.
